    <h1>Spencer B -- Version Control System -- May 2019</h1>

    <p>A version control system or VCS, also know as revision control or source control system, is a software utility
        that tracks and manages changes to a filesystem.
        A VCS also offers collaborative utilities to share and integrate these filesystem changes to other VCS users.
        When operating at the filesystem level, a VCS will track
        the addition, deletion, and modification actions applied to files and directories. A repository is a VCS term
        which describes when VCS is tracking a filesystem. In the
        scope of individual source code files, a VCS will track additions, deletions, modifications of the lines of text
        within that file. Popular software industry VCS options
        include Git, Mercurial, SVN and preforce.</p>
